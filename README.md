# Design Automation with Python

This repository demonstrates how common mechanical design calculations
can be automated using Python for repeatability and reduced manual effort.

## Scripts Included
- shaft_diameter.py – Shaft diameter calculation based on torsion
- bolt_shear_check.py – Bolt shear safety check

## Purpose
To showcase the application of programming in mechanical and product design
for reliable and reusable engineering calculations.
